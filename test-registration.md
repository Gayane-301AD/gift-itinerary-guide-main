## Testing Registration Functionality

### 1. Start Both Servers
```bash
# Terminal 1 - Backend
cd backend
npm run dev

### 3. Expected Behavior

✅ **Success Case**:
- Form submits without errors
- Success toast appears: "Account created successfully. You can now sign in."

3. **Expected Result**: Should log in successfully and redirect to dashboard

### 5. Database Verification

Check that the user was created in the database:

```sql
SELECT * FROM users WHERE email = 'test@example.com';
SELECT * FROM subscriptions WHERE email = 'test@example.com';
```
